# Spreadsheet

This is a spreadsheet which runs in the terminal, created in ruby. This was a project for CS 430 - Coding Languages, completed with a partner. 

The project consisted of us formulating our own programming language, complete with a grammer, lexer and parser. 
Primitive types such as ints, floats or boolean values can be inputted into cells, along with more complex statements,
such as for loops, if statements, and mathematical equations.
